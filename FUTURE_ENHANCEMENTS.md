# Cursor Rules CLI Future Enhancements (Made with AI, dogfooding `cursor-rules`)

This file tracks planned improvements and enhancements for the Cursor Rules CLI project.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Implement core CLI functionality
- [x] Create default rule templates
- [x] Support for TypeScript implementation
- [x] Implement interactive command-line prompts
- [x] Add Repomix integration for repository analysis
- [x] Documentation improvements

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Testing infrastructure setup

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add rule validation and linting
- [ ] Enhance rule templates for different project types
- [ ] Implement more specialized rule templates for different project types
- [ ] Integration with more code analysis tools
- [ ] Custom rule generation based on project analysis
- [ ] UI for rule management

## Implementation Plan

### Rule Validation and Linting
Implement a validation system that checks rule files for proper formatting, required sections, and valid metadata. This will help maintain consistency across rule files and prevent errors.

### Enhanced Rule Templates
Create specialized templates for common project types like:
- React/Next.js applications
- Node.js backend services
- Python applications
- Mobile app development
- Data science projects

### Code Analysis Integration
Connect with code analysis tools to generate more intelligent rule suggestions based on actual codebase structure and practices.

### Custom Rule Generation
Build functionality to analyze a project and automatically suggest rules based on its structure, dependencies, and patterns.

### UI for Rule Management
Develop a simple web interface for viewing, editing, and managing rules without relying solely on the CLI.
